    1- Load a customer, change the name and save again. Test using a
Controller. (DONE)

    2- Create a new page that renders a string using a view model.

    • Create a getter in the view model.
    • Create a template for this block, and access the getter in it.
    • Display the text in content container using layout
	(DONE)

    3- Create an extension that logs a list of routers from every request into a file. Log the router using get_class($router)
	(DONE)

    4- Add a new attribute to the product (Patch).

    • name: is_plastic
    • type: Boolean (Yes/No)
    • Appropriate Source Model from native Magento.
    • Add the attribute to the General Attribute group.
(DONE)



5- As you know in Magento we can login using Facebook, twitter etc.

    • So our requirement is to login using line (https://line.me/en/). 
    • Search the API provided by LINE then implement a module through which user can register or login to Magento (https://developers.line.biz/en/)
    • As you know magento needs email and password to login, so if email id cannot be retrieve, please add an intermediate step to get those information from user. 
Also it must be a separate module.

(DONE)
