5- As you know in Magento we can login using Facebook, twitter etc.

    • So our requirement is to login using line (https://line.me/en/). 
    • Search the API provided by LINE then implement a module through which user can register or login to Magento (https://developers.line.biz/en/)
    • As you know magento needs email and password to login, so if email id cannot be retrieve, please add an intermediate step to get those information from user. 
Also it must be a separate module.

(DONE)
